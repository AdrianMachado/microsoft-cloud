# What is Dev Proxy?

Dev Proxy is a command line tool that helps you simulate behaviors and errors of cloud APIs.

With Dev Proxy, you'll build resilient apps that gracefully handle errors and rate limits.

Dev Proxy is free and open source.

Use Dev Proxy to:

- simulate throttling and rate limiting on any API
- simulate errors
- mock API responses
- get contextual guidance about API usage
- explore API requests and responses

Dev Proxy works with any type of app, technology stack and programming language.

Identify and fix issues in your code early, before they reach production.
