# Intercept requests from specific processes

By default, Dev Proxy is registered as a system wide proxy and all requests made by your machine are passed through the proxy.

By default, the proxy intercepts requests that are made from your machine to the URLs configured in [devproxyrc.json](../technical-reference/devproxyrc.md) file.

However, you might also want to only intercept requests being made from specific processes such as a terminal window or web browser.

To intercept request from processes by their given process IDs, use the `--watch-pids` option:

```sh
devproxy â€“-watch-pids 870 135100
```

To intercept request from processes by their given process names, use the `--watch-process-names` option:

```sh
devproxy --watch-process-names msedge pwsh
```
