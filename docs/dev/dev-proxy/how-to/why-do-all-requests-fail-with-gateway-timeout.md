# Why do all requests fail with gateway timeout

If you're running the proxy for the first time, it can happen that the network access configuration didn't propagate timely and the proxy started without access to your network.

Close the proxy by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in proxy's window and restart the proxy and it should be working as intended.
