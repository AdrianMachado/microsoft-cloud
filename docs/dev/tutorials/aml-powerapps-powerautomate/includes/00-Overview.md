**Level**: Beginner

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace and deploy a Large Language model (LLM). You'll then integrate the LLM with Power Apps and Power Automate. Enhance your technical skills and explore the power of Azure and Power Automate in text generation and creative writing.

- **Azure Machine Learning**: Empowers data scientists and developers to build, deploy, and manage high-quality models faster and with confidence. It accelerates time to value with industry-leading machine learning operations (MLOps), open-source interoperability, and integrated tools. This trusted AI learning platform is designed for responsible AI applications in machine learning.
- **Power Apps**: Empower your team to start building and launching apps right away using an AI copilot, prebuilt templates, drag-and-drop simplicity, and quick deployment then roll out continuous improvements as needed. Give everyone the power to build the apps they need with advanced functionality previously only available to professional developers including pre-built components and AI-assisted natural language development. Provide professional developers the tools to seamlessly extend app capabilities with Azure Functions and custom connectors to proprietary or on-premises systems.
- **Power Automate**: Empower everyone to build automated processes using low-code, drag-and-drop tools. With hundreds of prebuilt connectors, thousands of templates, and AI assistance, itâ€™s easy to automate repetitive tasks. Record and visualize your end-to-end processes with Power Automate Process Mining. It takes the guesswork out of what to automate by providing guided recommendations for creating flows. Make your automation even smarter using generative AI capabilities in AI Builder. Create user-intuitive flows by embedding powerful language models and build unique scenarios with advanced low-code AI.

In this tutorial, you'll construct a Power App that captures user input, sends it to a Power Automate cloud flow, retrieves a response from your machine learning model, and displays the result on-screen. Here's an overview of the solution:
