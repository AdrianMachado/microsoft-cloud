# Microsoft Copilots Across the Microsoft Cloud

Microsoft Copilots are AI assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that offer innovative solutions across the Microsoft Cloud. They aim to enhance productivity, creativity, and data accessibility while providing enterprise-grade data security and privacy features. They bridge the gap between complex tasks and user-friendly solutions, providing a conversational interface to interact with data, create automations, build applications, and even assist in coding tasks. Their integration within various Microsoft and GitHub platforms provides a more interactive and efficient digital workspace. 

The core value of Copilots stems from their capability to interpret natural language commands, enhancing the user experience by making it more intuitive and user-friendly. From answering queries in Copilot Pro, assisting with data navigation and analysis in Microsoft 365, aiding in app and automation creation in Power Apps and Power Automate, to suggesting code in GitHub Copilot, they encapsulate the notion of having an AI-powered assistant at your fingertips. Copilots make complex tasks more manageable, fostering a collaborative environment for both individual users and enterprises.

## Extending Copilots

Microsoft Copilots offer a comprehensive range of features right out of the box, yet many users continue to depend on external tools, services, and data to carry out tasks. To bridge this gap, Copilots can be extended using plugins, connectors, or message extensions.

:::image type="content" source="media/copilots-across-microsoft-cloud-extend.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the adopt, extend, and build capabilities of Copilots across the Microsoft Cloud." border="false" :::

### Benefits of Extending Microsoft Copilots

By extending Microsoft Copilots, developers can integrate external data directly into Copilots to minimize user context shifts while enhancing productivity and collaboration. Copilots can also be extended to provide a new way for developers to surface external data directly in Microsoft products that users use everyday. For instance, enterprises and ISVs can build plugins to integrate their own line-of-business APIs and data directly into a Copilot.

Adding plugins, connectors, or message extensions to Microsoft Copilots helps users make the most out of these AI assistants. Users can more easily discover and work with enterprise data, tools, and services using natural language, which improves productivity and enhances teamwork.

#### Extending Copilots with Plugins

Plugins allow users to interact directly with APIs and services enhancing Copilot's capabilities and broadening its range of functionality by pulling in external data. For example, plugins can enable a Copilot to retrieve real-time data, such as the latest news coverage on a product launch, or knowledge-based information such as a team's project items.

One example of plugins is Power Platform Connectors which offer a set of prebuilt actions and triggers for developers to build their own apps and workflows. They can be used to extend Copilot in Microsoft 365 and Copilots in Power Platform experiences with data from external apps.

Developers can also create plugins that use OpenAI schemas to add custom functionality to Copilot experiences by connecting their own application data to Microsoft Copilot. Plugins enable a Copilot experience to interact with your own APIs, enhancing the experience with the ability to perform a wide range of actions.

#### Extending Copilots with Microsoft Graph Connectors

Microsoft Graph connectors import external content into Microsoft 365. Once the content is imported, all of Microsoft 365 including search, context IQ, microsoft365.com, and Microsoft 365 Copilot can access the content. Microsoft Graph connectors are responsible for three key tasks:

1. Creating an external connection to your data sources
1. Defining a schema for the external content
1. Managing external content that’s imported into Microsoft 365

#### Extending Copilots with Message Extensions

Message extensions allow users to interact with enterprise services through Microsoft Teams chats. They can search or initiate actions in an external service and post that information, in the form of adaptive cards, into a Teams message. By using message extensions, you can extend the built-in functionality of Copilot for Microsoft 365.
