# Copilots Across the Microsoft Cloud

Microsoft Copilots are AI assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that offer innovative solutions across the Microsoft Cloud. They aim to enhance productivity, creativity, and data accessibility while providing enterprise-grade data security and privacy features. They bridge the gap between complex tasks and user-friendly solutions, providing a conversational interface to interact with data, create automations, build applications, and even assist in coding tasks. Their integration within various Microsoft and GitHub platforms provides a more interactive and efficient digital workspace. 

The core value of Copilots stems from their capability to interpret natural language commands, enhancing the user experience by making it more intuitive and user-friendly. From answering queries in Bing Chat Enterprise, assisting with data navigation and analysis in Microsoft 365, aiding in app and automation creation in Power Apps and Power Automate, to suggesting code in GitHub Copilot, they encapsulate the notion of having an AI-powered assistant at your fingertips. Copilots make complex tasks more manageable, fostering a collaborative environment for both individual users and enterprises.

## Extending Copilots

[NOTE: Early, early draft just to gets some words started. This will change and some of it won't be included.]

Microsoft Copilots are AI-powered productivity assistants that integrate with Microsoft products to enhance user creativity and productivity. They're designed to work seamlessly in products such as Windows, Bing, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Power Apps, Power Automate, and many more. While Copilots provide a robust set of functionality out of the box, many users still rely on external tools, services, and data to perform tasks. To bridge this gap, Copilots can be extended using plugins, connectors, or message extensions.

### Benefits of Extending Microsoft Copilots

By extending Microsoft Copilots, developers can integrate external data directly into Copilots to minimize user context shifts while enhancing productivity and collaboration. Copilot extensions also provide a new way for developers to surface external data in Microsoft products that users engage with and use everyday. For instance, enterprise companies can build plugins to integrate their own line-of-business APIs and data directly into a Copilot. ISVs can harness Copilot capabilities via Microsoft Graph connectors and Power Platform connectors to enable Copilot experiences with data from partner apps.

By extending Microsoft Copilots with plugins, connectors, or message extensions, users can leverage the power of these tools to their fullest potential, enhancing productivity and collaboration by integrating with a wide range of third-party tools and services.

#### Extending Copilots with Plugins

Plugins allow users to interact directly with APIs and services enhancing Copilot's capabilities and broadening its range of functionalities by pulling in external data. For example, plugins can enable a Copilot to retrieve real-time information, such as the latest news coverage on a product launch, or knowledge-based information like a team's project items. 

One example of plugins is Power Platform Connectors. Power Platform connectors offer a set of prebuilt actions and triggers for developers to build their apps and workflows, and can be used to extend Copilot in Microsoft 365 and Copilots in Power Platform experiences with data from external apps.

- [Create a Custom Connector from Scratch](/connectors/custom-connectors/define-blank)

#### Extending Copilots with Microsoft Graph Connectors

Microsoft Graph connectors import external content into Microsoft 365. Once, the content is imported, all of Microsoft 365 including search, context IQ, microsoft365.com, and Microsoft 365 Copilot can access the content. Microsoft Graph connectors are responsible for three things:

1. Creating an external connection to your data sources
1. Defining a schema for the external content
1. Managing external content that’s imported into Microsoft 365

- [Publish your Custom Microsoft Graph Connector](/graph/custom-connector-sdk-sample-publish)

#### Extending Copilots with Message Extensions

Message extensions allow users to interact with enterprise services through Microsoft Teams chats. They can search or initiate actions in an external service and post that information, in the form of adaptive cards, into a Teams message. By using message extension, you can extend the built-in functionality of Microsoft 365 Copilot.
