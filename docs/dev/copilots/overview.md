# Copilots Across the Microsoft Cloud

Microsoft Copilots are AI assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that offer innovative solutions across the Microsoft Cloud. They aim to enhance productivity, creativity, and data accessibility while providing enterprise-grade data security and privacy features. They bridge the gap between complex tasks and user-friendly solutions, providing a conversational interface to interact with data, create automations, build applications, and even assist in coding tasks. Their integration within various Microsoft and GitHub platforms provides a more interactive and efficient digital workspace. 

The core value of copilots stems from their capability to interpret natural language commands, enhancing the user experience by making it more intuitive and user-friendly. From answering queries in Bing Chat Enterprise, assisting with data navigation and analysis in Microsoft 365, aiding in app and automation creation in Power Apps and Power Automate, to suggesting code in GitHub Copilot, they encapsulate the notion of having an AI-powered assistant at your fingertips. Copilots make complex tasks more manageable, fostering a collaborative environment for both individual users and enterprises. 

## Adopting Copilots

The Microsoft Cloud offers a variety of copilots that can be adopted to enhance your productivity and creativity.

### Bing Chat Enterprise
 
Bing Chat Enterprise utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI to improve data access and boost user productivity and creativity in the enterprise workspace. It provides a secure AI-powered chat with commercial data protection, ensuring user and business data safety. The system doesn't save chat data and restricts data access, including from Microsoft, ensuring privacy. User data isn't used for model training, maintaining data integrity. Bing Chat Enterprise offers accurate, verifiable, and visual answers from web data, aligning with Microsoft's responsible AI principles, making it a secure and efficient tool for modern enterprises.

### Copilot in Power Apps

The AI Copilot in Power Apps enables app creators to build applications more efficiently than ever. It enables the construction of an app, along with its data, by articulating the requirements through a conversational, natural language approach over several steps. This feature ensures a Copilot-driven experience from the initial screen, offering users a more conversational and less click-intensive interaction as they build apps.

### Copilot in Power Automate 
 
Power Automate Copilot in cloud flows simplifies automation creation using natural language expressions. Users describe what they need through conversation, and Copilot assists by understanding intent, setting up connections, applying necessary parameters, and making requested changes to the flow. It can also be used to answer queries about the flow or product.
