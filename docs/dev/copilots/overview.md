## Extend a Copilot

Microsoft Copilots offer a comprehensive range of features right out of the box, yet many users continue to depend on external tools, services, and data to carry out tasks. To bridge this gap, Copilots can be extended using plugins, connectors, or message extensions.

:::image type="content" source="media/copilots-across-microsoft-cloud-extend.png" alt-text="A diagram showing extend options for Copilots across the Microsoft Cloud." border="false" :::

### Benefits of Extending Microsoft Copilots

By extending Microsoft Copilots, developers can integrate external data directly into Copilots to minimize user context shifts while enhancing productivity and collaboration. Copilots can also be extended to provide a new way for developers to surface external data directly in Microsoft products that users use everyday. For instance, enterprises and ISVs can build plugins to integrate their own line-of-business APIs and data directly into a Copilot.

Adding plugins, connectors, or message extensions to Microsoft Copilots helps users make the most out of these AI assistants. Users can more easily discover and work with enterprise data, tools, and services using natural language, which improves productivity and enhances teamwork.

#### Extending with Plugins

Plugins allow users to interact directly with APIs and services enhancing Copilot's capabilities and broadening its range of functionality by pulling in external data. For example, plugins can enable a Copilot to retrieve real-time data, such as the latest news coverage on a product launch, or knowledge-based information such as a team's project items.

One example of plugins is Power Platform Connectors which offer a set of prebuilt actions and triggers for developers to build their own apps and workflows. They can be used to extend Copilot in Microsoft 365 and Copilots in Power Platform experiences with data from external apps.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-platform-connector.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the key tasks that a Power Platform connector performs." border="false" :::

Developers can also create plugins that use OpenAI schemas to add custom functionality to Copilot experiences by connecting their own application data to Microsoft Copilot. Plugins enable a Copilot experience to interact with your own APIs, enhancing the experience with the ability to perform a wide range of actions.

- [Overview of Plugins for Microsoft Copilot](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/copilot-plugins/overview?branch=pr-en-us-1)

#### Extending with Microsoft Graph Connectors

Microsoft Graph connectors import external content into Microsoft 365. Once the content is imported, all of Microsoft 365 including search, context IQ, microsoft365.com, and Microsoft 365 Copilot can access the content. Microsoft Graph connectors are responsible for three key tasks:

1. Creating an external connection in Microsoft 365
1. Defining a schema for the external content
1. Managing external content thatâ€™s imported into Microsoft 365

#### Extending with Teams Message Extensions

Message extensions allow users to interact with enterprise services through Microsoft Teams chats. They can search or initiate actions in an external service and post that information, in the form of adaptive cards, into a Teams message. By using message extensions, you can extend the built-in functionality of Copilot for Microsoft 365.

## Build a Custom Copilot

In addition to adopting and extending a Microsoft Copilot, custom AI Copilots can be created to create a personalized conversational AI experience for users using Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Search, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and other Microsoft Cloud technologies. Custom Copilots can integrate company data and documents, retrieve real-time data from external APIs, and be embedded in company applications. For example, a custom Copilot can be built to provide a chat interface to access help desk tickets and knowledge base articles. Rather than using traditional search techniques or navigating across multiple applications, users can use the conversational UI provided by the custom Copilot to find the information they need.

:::image type="content" source="media/copilots-across-microsoft-cloud-build.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the build options for creating custom Copilots." border="false" :::

### Use Azure OpenAI Models and Cognitive Search To Chat with Your Own Data

Companies can integrate their own data with Azure OpenAI models to create an advanced conversational AI platform that can be embedded in their applications. This enables users to interact with company data and documents using natural language, making it easier to find information and complete tasks.
