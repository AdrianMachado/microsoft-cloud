If you terminate the Microsoft 365 Developer Proxy process, the proxy won't be able to unregister itself and you won't have network connection on your machine.

To restore network connection, start the proxy and close it by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, which will gracefully close the proxy unregistering it on your machine and restoring the regular network connection.
