The proxy can be configured to use ASCII icons instead of text labels in the console output.

The table below describes each icon.

| Icon | Description |
| ----- | ------------ |
|`← ←`| Proxy has intercepted the request |
|`↑ ↑`| Proxy has ignored a request and passed it through |
|`× →`| Proxy has simulated an API error |
|`/!\`| Proxy has returned a performance warning |
|`o →`| Proxy has mocked the response |
|`! →`| Request has failed |
|`(i)`| Proxy has provided developer guidance |

To use icons instead of labels, follow the [Change console output to use icons](./Change-console-output-to-use-icons) guide.
