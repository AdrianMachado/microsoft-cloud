To exclude a URL from being intercepted, prepend it with an `!` (exclamation mark): 

```json
"urlsToWatch": [
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/*",
    "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/*",
    "https://graph.microsoft.us/v1.0/*",
    "https://graph.microsoft.us/beta/*",
    "https://dod-graph.microsoft.us/v1.0/*",
    "https://dod-graph.microsoft.us/beta/*",
    "https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn/v1.0/*",
    "https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn/beta/*",
    "!https://*.sharepoint.*/*_api/web/GetClientSideComponents",
    "https://*.sharepoint.*/*_api/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint.*/*_vti_bin/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint-df.*/*_api/*",
    "https://*.sharepoint-df.*/*_vti_bin/*"
],
```

In the above example, any requests made to `/_api/web/GetClientSideComponents` will be ignored.

When excluding URLs, keep in mind that proxy will look for matching URLs in the order in which theyâ€™re defined in the configuration. 

If you want to exclude specific URLs, you should define them first, before more global URL matches.
